An open-source, community-driven knowledge base of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for attacking and defending Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google Workspace environments.



## üéØ About The Project

As organizations increasingly rely on Google Cloud, understanding the specific threat landscape becomes critical. This project aims to be the most comprehensive and up-to-date public resource for security professionals, mapping adversary behaviors to the MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ framework.

This matrix is designed for:
* **Red Teamers & Pentesters** to discover and simulate attack paths.
* **Blue Teamers & Defenders** to build detection and response strategies.
* **Cloud Architects** to design more secure infrastructure from the ground up.

##  MATRIX

The full, detailed matrix is located in a separate file to keep this README clean and focused.
